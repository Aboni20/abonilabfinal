    <p id="about">A highly motivated and dedicated individual with a profound interest in the tech and entertainment industry, I possess a comprehensive background in co-curricular activities that demonstrate exceptional communication, leadership, and innovative prowess. I have actively participated in co-curricular activities since my school days, including debates, presentations, and science fairs. Through these activities, I have developed and refined my skills in communication, leadership, and innovation. I gained valuable experience working with various organizations such as Garena, NDF BD, Higgsino Science Society, Protiti Bitorko Songho, etc., where I successfully organized and executed events. Previously, I served as an Affiliate Coordinator in the affiliation (sales) team at 10 Minute School. I was also actively involved as a Community Moderator for Garena Free Fire, where I contributed to the success of the organization and further improved my communication and interpersonal skills. Additionally, I had the opportunity to study as an Erasmus+ exchange student in Sweden, which further enriched my cultural understanding and adaptability in a global context.</p>
